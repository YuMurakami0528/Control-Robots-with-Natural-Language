# Control-Robots-with-Natural-Language

Based on Category Theory, I have defined categories of natural language and categories of topology, and have considered how to control robots by words by mapping natural language and topology. Although words and topology are inherently different, it is possible to map them by applying the functor of Category Theory.

To control robots using category theory, we'll create two categories, one for natural language (Category_NL) and one for topology (Category_Topology). Then, we'll define functors between these categories to map sentences to robot movements. Here's a high-level overview of how to do it:

Define Category_NL: This category has objects as sentences (strings) and morphisms as functions that relate these sentences.
Define Category_Topology: This category has objects as topological spaces (e.g., the robot's configuration space) and morphisms as continuous functions between these spaces.
Define a functor F: Category_NL -> Category_Topology: This functor maps sentences (strings) in Category_NL to corresponding robot movements in Category_Topology.
Implement the categories and the functor in Python.
Here's a simple implementation in Python:

# Define objects and morphisms for Category_NL
class Sentence:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content = content

class SentenceMorphism:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

# Define objects and morphisms for Category_Topology
class TopologicalSpace:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class ContinuousFunction:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

# Define Functor F
class FunctorF:
    def map_object(self, sentence):
        if sentence.content == "move_forward":
            return TopologicalSpace("forward")
        elif sentence.content == "turn_left":
            return TopologicalSpace("left")
        elif sentence.content == "turn_right":
            return TopologicalSpace("right")
        else:
            return TopologicalSpace("unknown")

    def map_morphism(self, sentence_morphism):
        def continuous_function(topological_space):
            new_space = sentence_morphism.function(topological_space.name)
            return TopologicalSpace(new_space)

        return ContinuousFunction(continuous_function)

# Example usage
sentence = Sentence("move_forward")
functor = FunctorF()
robot_movement = functor.map_object(sentence)
print(robot_movement.name)  # Output: forward

A more detailed implementation would involve using a natural language processing library, such as SpaCy, to parse sentences, and a more sophisticated way to represent topological spaces for the robot's configuration. Here is an example implementation using SpaCy for parsing and NumPy for representing robot's configuration:

import spacy
import numpy as np

# Load SpaCy's English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Define objects and morphisms for Category_NL
class Sentence:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content = content
        self.parse()

    def parse(self):
        self.doc = nlp(self.content)

class SentenceMorphism:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

# Define objects and morphisms for Category_Topology
class ConfigurationSpace:
    def __init__(self, position, orientation):
        self.position = position
        self.orientation = orientation

class ContinuousFunction:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

# Define Functor F
class FunctorF:
    def map_object(self, sentence):
        action = None
        for token in sentence.doc:
            if token.pos_ == 'VERB':
                action = token.lemma_

        if action == 'move':
            return self.move_forward(sentence)
        elif action == 'turn':
            return self.turn(sentence)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Unknown action.')

    def move_forward(self, sentence):
        distance = 1.0
        for token in sentence.doc:
            if token.pos_ == 'NUM':
                distance = float(token.text)
        return ContinuousFunction(lambda config: ConfigurationSpace(config.position + distance * config.orientation, config.orientation))

    def turn(self, sentence):
        direction = None
        for token in sentence.doc:
            if token.text in ['left', 'right']:
                direction = token.text

        if direction == 'left':
            angle = np.pi / 2
        elif direction == 'right':
            angle = -np.pi / 2
        else:
            raise ValueError('Unknown direction.')

        def rotation(config):
            rot_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)], [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])
            new_orientation = np.dot(rot_matrix, config.orientation)
            return ConfigurationSpace(config.position, new_orientation)

        return ContinuousFunction(rotation)

# Example usage
start_config = ConfigurationSpace(np.array([0, 0]), np.array([1, 0]))
sentence = Sentence("move forward 3")
functor = FunctorF()
continuous_function = functor.map_object(sentence)
new_config = continuous_function.function(start_config)
print(new_config.position)  # Output: [3, 0]

In this implementation, we use SpaCy to parse the sentence and extract the verb and other relevant information, like distance or direction. The robot's configuration is represented by position and orientation as NumPy arrays. We define move_forward and turn methods in FunctorF to create continuous functions that change the robot's configuration accordingly.

For a more detailed implementation, we can extend the categories to handle more complex robot movements, use more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and build a comprehensive system that can control the robot. Here's an example using SpaCy for NLP and a more sophisticated configuration representation using Robot Operating System (ROS):

Note: This example assumes that you have ROS installed and set up in your system.

Install the necessary Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pip install rospy
Create a ROS package and add the following Python script:
python
Copy code
# robot_controller.py
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
import spacy
import numpy as np

# Load SpaCy's English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Define objects and morphisms for Category_NL
class Sentence:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content = content
        self.parse()

    def parse(self):
        self.doc = nlp(self.content)

class SentenceMorphism:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

# Define objects and morphisms for Category_Topology
class ConfigurationSpace:
    def __init__(self, twist):
        self.twist = twist

class ContinuousFunction:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

# Define Functor F
class FunctorF:
    def map_object(self, sentence):
        action = None
        for token in sentence.doc:
            if token.pos_ == 'VERB':
                action = token.lemma_

        if action == 'move':
            return self.move_forward(sentence)
        elif action == 'turn':
            return self.turn(sentence)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Unknown action.')

    def move_forward(self, sentence):
        distance = 1.0
        for token in sentence.doc:
            if token.pos_ == 'NUM':
                distance = float(token.text)

        twist = Twist()
        twist.linear.x = distance

        return ContinuousFunction(lambda _: ConfigurationSpace(twist))

    def turn(self, sentence):
        direction = None
        for token in sentence.doc:
            if token.text in ['left', 'right']:
                direction = token.text

        if direction == 'left':
            angle = np.pi / 2
        elif direction == 'right':
            angle = -np.pi / 2
        else:
            raise ValueError('Unknown direction.')

        twist = Twist()
        twist.angular.z = angle

        return ContinuousFunction(lambda _: ConfigurationSpace(twist))

# ROS-related functions
def process_sentence(sentence):
    functor = FunctorF()
    continuous_function = functor.map_object(sentence)
    return continuous_function.function(None)

def execute_movement(config_space):
    rospy.init_node('robot_controller', anonymous=True)
    pub = rospy.Publisher('/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
    rate = rospy.Rate(10)

    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        pub.publish(config_space.twist)
        rate.sleep()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_sentence = input("Enter the command: ")
    sentence = Sentence(input_sentence)
    config_space = process_sentence(sentence)
    execute_movement(config_space)

In this implementation, we utilize ROS to send Twist messages to the robot, which control its linear and angular velocities. We also added a loop in the execute_movement function to keep publishing the velocities until the user terminates the script. You can further extend this script to handle more complex commands and other robot configurations.
